# vidhancemobile.com
Website for vidhancemobile.com.

The site is built with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) and deployed to Github Pages.

Changes to the repository will trigger a [Wercker](http://wercker.com/) script that builds and deploys the site automatically.

To run this site on a local computer follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Go to https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases and download the latest release. (v0.14 was used to build this site)
3. Stand in the root folder of the cloned repository and run "hugo -w server" to start a local webserver hosting the site and that refreshes the site when a file is edited.
