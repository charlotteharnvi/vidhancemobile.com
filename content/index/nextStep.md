# No Sensors, no buffers, no delays.
Excellent results from smartphone video require both motion sensors (like accelerometers) and optical flow stabilization.

Vidhance adds the latter, analyzing the video data only. Vidhance separates intended motion from unintended motion, and cancels out the latter. All of this is achieved in real-time, before the next video frame arrives from the camera.

With no look-ahead frame buffers needed, performance can be increased, battery life improved, and the smooth video is readily available for preview, live feeds and encoding.
